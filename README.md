# Methanol-Column-Pressurization-Analysis
I'm currently doing this project and the problem statement for this project is basicaly there is a Methanol Recovery Section Column in one of the plant in my current organsiation and it is having pressurization problem i.e. it is getting pressurized intermitently. So, I'm using Data Analysis skills to find the parameter (Flow, PH of the feed like wise) which is causing this problem.
In this code, I'm using Python Language, editor I have used is Jupyter notbook and haven't attached the dataset due to data securities issue. 
Have a look.
